# Welcome to My Power BI Projects Repository!

## About Me
I am a passionate data enthusiast with a strong focus on data visualization and analysis using Power BI and Tableau. I have developed a solid foundation in various visualization techniques, allowing me to dive deep into complex datasets and extract actionable insights that drive decision-making. This repository showcases my journey into the world of data analysis, featuring key projects where I applied advanced visualization methods to uncover trends, patterns, and solutions.

## Projects

### 1. Road Accident Analysis
- **Description**: A comprehensive analysis of road accident data. This project focuses on identifying patterns, accident-prone areas, and key factors that contribute to road accidents.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Accident hotspots
  - Time and weather factors
  - Map Grid for Accident Analysis
- **Tools Used**: Power BI
- **Power Query Techniques**:
  - **Data Filtering**: Applied filters to clean the dataset by removing irrelevant data points (e.g., outliers, null values) and focusing on specific accident causes and locations.
- **Data Model Techniques**:
  - **Managing Relationships**: Created relationships between multiple data tables (accident data, weather conditions, and location data) to enable more insightful cross-analysis in the reports.

### 2. Sales Market Analysis
- **Description**: An exploration of market sales data to uncover trends in sales volume, customer behavior, and product performance across different regions and time periods.
- **Key Insights**:
  - Top-performing products
  - Sales trends by region and season
  - Customer purchase patterns
  - Map analysis by revenue
- **Tools Used**: Power BI
- **Power Query Techniques**:
  - **Data Filtering**: Used Power Query to filter sales transactions based on date, region, and product categories to focus on specific market segments.
- **Data Model Techniques**:
  - **Managing Relationships**: Built a data model linking sales data with product and customer tables, enabling powerful insights across sales, customer demographics, and product lines.

### 3. IPL Dataset Analysis (Ongoing)
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing IPL cricket data to explore player performance, team dynamics, and match outcomes. Visualizations will provide insights into trends across different seasons, player statistics, and match predictions.
- **Tools Using**: Power BI

## What’s Next?
I am constantly learning and working on new datasets. Currently, I’m delving deeper into machine learning, improving my skills with Python and scikit-learn, and looking forward to building more advanced data projects.
